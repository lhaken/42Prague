# SUDO üõ°Ô∏è
***
In order to solidify our server's security, we need to set up a strong sudo configuration. What that configuration is supposed to look like can be found in [[#REQUIREMENTS ‚úÖ | requirements]].
***
## INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING SUDO
First, we need to change our user to root as our current user doesn't have the permissions we need. To login as root execute: ^167938
```
su
```

^79b243

And enter your root password. After that run:
```
apt install sudo
```
To make sure our changes will apply, we have to reboot the machine:
```
sudo reboot
```
As per the subject, the user with our intra login for a username, has to be in groups: **sudo** and **user42**. Let's create the **user42** group:
```
sudo addgroup user42
```
To add our user, in my case **lhaken**, into the groups run:
```
sudo adduser lhaken user42
sudo adduser lhaken sudo
```

Now head back to [[born2beroot#^88ea66 | the project guide]] and continue with the next step.

## IMPLEMENTING STRICT RULES
Bellow you can see what are the rules:
***
### REQUIREMENTS ‚úÖ
- [.] authentication has to be limited to 3 tries
- [.] a custom message when a wrong password is entered
- [.] each action using sudo has to be archived (input and output) and the log will be saved in /var/log/sudo/
- [.] TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons
- [.] sudo can only be executed in some paths
***
First, we can create the directory where our sudo log will be logged:
```
mkdir /var/log/sudo
```
Then let's also create the logfile itself while we are at it:
```
touch /var/log/sudo/sudo.log
```
After we created the log directory, we can proceed with writing our rules into a file, open the file for writing:
```
nano /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
```
Now let's write the rules one by one (write the following lines into the **sudo_config** file):
1) **Limit authentication to 3 tries**
	```
	Defaults passwd_tries=3
	```
2) **Custom error message**
	```
	Defaults badpass_message="Don't you know your password?!"
	```
3) **Logging each action and saving the log**
	 **Setting the logfile**
	```
	Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
	```
	 **Set up what will be logged**
	```
	Defaults log_input, log_output
	```
4) **Enable TTY**
	```
	Defaults requiretty
	```
5) **Paths where sudo is executable**
	```
	secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
	```

Now that all the rules are set up, head back to [[born2beroot#^3b2b64 | the project guide]] and continue with the next step.
